I want to make a program that will scrape craigslist and alert me when new apartments under 500 are available.
With this program I want it to:
  -Make the program sort out junk postings
  -sort out duplicate postings
  -after finding 5 new apartments I want it to email me those apartments
  -save apartments to an excel document and delete postings after they are removed from craigslist but still make sure I am not shown apartments I have seen before
    >Also make the excel document remove blank lines when apartments are deleted
